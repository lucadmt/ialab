# IA&Lab

This repository contains the projects I developed for the ai course while in university. It contains:

* prolog-asp
	* Prolog\
		This contains an implementation of the IDA* algorithm in prolog, and uses it to search for a solution of the 15-puzzle game.
	* ASP\
		Constraint Satisfaction Problems. It contains the code necessary to automatically generate the correct timetable for a fictitious sport's tournament.
* clips\
		Expert Systems. It contains an implementation of a system that uses Confidence Intervals to determine the best match for houses, given the user's preferences.
* soar\
		Cognitive Architectures & Reinforcement Learning. It contains an implementation of a puzzle where the agent must try to escape a room with only a window. The agent has some objects that it can use to make progress towards its goal. By using reinforcement learning it learns to break the window by combining such objects and climbs its way to freedom.
